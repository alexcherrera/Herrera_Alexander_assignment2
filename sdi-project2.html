<p>A boy by the name of Herbert wanted to buy a pet for his birthday. The store has a policy that people can start buying pets at the age of 15. When he went to the pet store he saw many animals displayed but each animal had a different price tag ranging from $30-$100. Herbert spent one whole day spending time with each of the animals to see which one will be his pet. He spent more time with some animals compared to the others and lastly the animal that he picked was a dog.
